# IS211_Course_Project

Hi Professor,

I decided to do a Pet ecommerce store, like Amazon but for your pet. I had a friend design the icons for me, but besides that I've implemented everything in Python, HTML and CSS (a lot of CSS). I ran out of time before I could really get the project up and running on the backend, so I apologize for that. However, it was a lot of work, using grid and flexbox to get the site navbar and footer as well as the content to stay in place. I know this wasn't neccesarily Python, but I did learn a lot. I will add to this as the days go on, and hopefully by time you see it, there will be more python code involved. I do use sqlite to house the data. You can also change isAdmin and isLoggedIn to see how the navbar changes. 

Please let me know if something isn't working or right. 

Thanks, 

Tim



# Running the assignment

- If the virtual environment is not created already create one and activate it in the terminal of the IS2111_Course_Project folder: 
  - `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`
- Installing dependencies: they are in the requirements.txt file run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If you need to create and seed the database run `python ./script/seed.py` from the terminal inside of the IS211_Course_Project folder
- To run the actual flask application I believe it's gonna be `python app.py` in the terminal
- To deactivate the virtual environment in use: `deactivate`
